# Be My Neighbor




## It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood, a neighborly day to volunteer, would you be my, could you be my, won't you be my neighbor?



### Neighbor is the product of community-oriented developers who grew up asking, “Won’t you be my Neighbor?” 

Our goal is to create more accessible opportunities to help those in our community through volunteering, offering goods, and engaging in local community projects. If you are in need of help, or want to help, all you need to do is turn to your Neighbor.

### App Functions:

Community members who need an item or service can save money by posting their needs on the app, alerting their nearby Neighbors of an opportunity to help. 

Members can both create and search for local community volunteer opportunities. Localizing volunteership means less competition and no need to wait!

Members can add useful skills to their profile, allowing other users to see if they are a good fit for a job.

Members can upload photos to their job posts and all users can see who has applied for a specific job.

### Future enhancements:

In the future, our team seeks to add to our user's profile customization, including the number of people helped and a rating for how "helpful" this user has been in the past. 

Our team also plans to auto-remove posts from the main feed if the post has met the requirement for # of volunteers. In addition, we want to enable users to "approve" volunteers who sign up for their job prior to including the volunteers in the total count.
